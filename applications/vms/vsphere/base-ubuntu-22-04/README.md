## This is a simple set of packer files for my vCenter homelab

Several of these are IN PROGRESS.  AKA this doesn't QUITE work yet.  It builds
a base OS but have had issues with ubuntu 22.04 missing packages OR just...
flat out not working great on microk8s.  SO USE AT YOUR OWN RISK :) 

It's got a public key I even use for my local installs ;) so don't use on an
EC2 unless you want me remoting into it ;)
