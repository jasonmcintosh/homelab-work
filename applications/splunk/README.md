## Splunk example (free) and a sample dashboard.  

MOSTLY built using:
https://splunk.github.io/docker-splunk/


Built off of 
https://docs.armory.io/continuous-deployment/armory-admin/observe/integrations-logging/#enable-logging-data

and

https://spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/features/notifications/

LOT of data here, so CAUTION!  as it has the FULL context, stage stop, start, etc.  HIGHLY Recommend event filtering if you can do it (armory has a plugin for this)
